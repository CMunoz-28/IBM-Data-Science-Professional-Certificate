# What is Data Science?

Data Science is the practice of **collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data** to discover insights, solve problems, and support decision-making. It combines techniques from **statistics, computer science, and domain expertise** to turn raw data into meaningful information.

At its core, data science answers questions such as:
- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- What is likely to happen next?
- What actions should be taken?

## The Data Science Process

Data science follows a structured workflow known as the **data science lifecycle**:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Define the problem and identify what success looks like.

2. **Data Collection**  
   Gather data from sources such as databases, APIs, files, or web scraping.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   Fix missing values, remove errors, and structure the data for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Use statistics and visualization to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies.

5. **Modeling & Analysis**  
   Apply statistical models or machine learning to extract insights or make predictions.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Validate whether the model or analysis is reliable and accurate.

7. **Communication & Decision-Making**  
   Present findings through reports, dashboards, or visualizations so stakeholders can take action.

## What Does a Data Scientist Do?

A data scientist combines **technical skills** and **business thinking** to turn data into value. Their work typically includes:

- Writing Python and SQL to work with data  
- Performing statistical analysis and machine learning  
- Building visualizations and dashboards  
- Explaining results to non-technical stakeholders  
- Supporting strategy, marketing, finance, and product decisions  

They act as a **bridge between data and business outcomes**.

## Why Data Science Matters

In modern organizations, data science enables:

- Better customer understanding  
- More accurate forecasting  
- Smarter marketing and pricing decisions  
- Risk reduction  
- Operational efficiency  

Rather than relying on intuition, companies use data science to make **evidence-based decisions**.

Understanding what data science is ensures that technical skills are applied **with purpose and context**.
