# What is Data Science?

## Course Overview

This folder contains my work for **Course 1 – What is Data Science?** from the  
**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)**.

This course establishes the **conceptual foundation of data science**, including:

- What data science is and how it is used in organizations  
- The role of a data scientist  
- How data science supports decision-making  
- The data science lifecycle  
- Career paths and required skills  

This material forms the **business and analytical framework** behind all technical work completed later in the certificate.

## Why This Matters for Employers

Understanding what data science is — beyond just writing code — is what allows analysts and scientists to:

- Frame business problems correctly  
- Ask the right questions  
- Interpret model outputs  
- Communicate insights to stakeholders  

This foundation ensures that later technical work is **strategic, not just technical**.
